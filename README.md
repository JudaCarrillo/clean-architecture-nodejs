# Clean Architecture in Node.js

This is a monorepo that contains exercises and examples of how to implement the Clean Architecture in Node.js.
From basic applications to more complex ones, you will find examples of how to implement the Clean Architecture in Node.js.

## What is Clean Architecture?
The Clean Architecture is a software design philosophy that separates the software into layers. Each layer has a specific responsibility and knows only about the layers below it. This separation allows for better maintainability, testability, and scalability.

## Layers
The Clean Architecture is composed of the following layers:
1. **Domain**: Contains the business rules and the data structures.
2. **Application**: Contains the application-specific business rules.
3. **Infrastructure**: Contains the implementation of the interfaces defined in the Domain layer.

It is important know that the layers can be named differently depending on the author, but the concepts are the same.
